In short, given a collection of 5-character words, can we find 5 such that we cover 25 characters?
I was introduced to this problem by watching this video by Matt Parker / Standup Maths, and coincidentally, I recently had an exam on approximation algorithms, and I thought, why not. Turns out, using an approximate solution, and then rounding can give us an optimal solution faster than - as far as I can tell - any other approach.</description></item></channel></rss>
