My name is Quinn.
I am a graduate student at [redacted], with a focus on ML.
My academic interests revolve around NLP, RL, and Geometric Deep Learning, besides that I have a deep love for optimization.
I am currently working at [redacted] as a SDE.

In short, given a collection of 5-character words, can we find 5 such that we cover 25 characters?
I was introduced to this problem by watching this video by Matt Parker / Standup Maths, and coincidentally, I recently had an exam on approximation algorithms, and I thought, why not. Turns out, using an approximate solution, and then rounding can give us an optimal solution faster than - as far as I can tell - any other approach.</description></item><item><title>Optimization</title><link>https://partiallytyped.github.io/tags/optimization/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://partiallytyped.github.io/tags/optimization/</guid><description>Linear Programming and Approximations Jotto: 5 words, 25 characters, 1500ms</description></item></channel></rss>
